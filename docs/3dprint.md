## Where to 3D Print
### ECE Makerspace

This video shows you how to use the Lulzbot 3D printers specific to the ECE Makerspace in Jacobs Hall Basement. Note these are FDM printers that use only colored PLA filament.

**You will need to watch this video to pass the quiz for access to the printers:**

### Other Locations

On UCSD campus you may also check out these other places that offer 3D printing: 

* [Digital Media Lab](https://library.ucsd.edu/computing-and-technology/digital-media-lab)
* [Envision Maker Studio](https://jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/envision)

## 3D Printing Assignment

!!! question

    ### Makerspace Quiz
    **1. [Complete the ECE Makespace 3D Printing Quiz](https://forms.gle/Mihe9oVGfEPwb76y7)** (You will be unable to 3D print your parts below if you do not complete this quiz)

    ### Design Small Piece
    **2. Obtain an `.stl` of a small item: ** 

    * **Design your own using CAD software.** Use whichever you want, here are some examples:
        * [Onshape - Get free plan](https://www.onshape.com/en/products/free)
        * Solidworks - Free with Student Access code from UCSD
        * Autodesk Fusion 360
    * Downloading premade model [online](https://thingiverse.com) is also OK if customized.
    * Please keep it small - About 75mm^3 (3 cubic inches) or less: 
        * Larger prints take much longer time
        * Larger models can be scaled down in the printer software
        * Less infill, lower resolution settings = Faster print

    ### Print the Piece
    **3. Print the piece** using ECE Makerspace or other printer. Take a picture of the completed print.
    
    ### Deliverables
    **4. Upload **both the `.stl` and picture of completed print** to the Google form posted on Canvas

    WI22 Note: Since we are unable to print this in the first two weeks, we will print the nametag when we are able to return in the makerspace. The design is still due by the due date mentioned in class. If you have access to 3D printer outside class you may also use that to complete the assignment.
