### [Problem 1]

!!!question
    **Brainstorming time!**

    Based of of the topics and uses talked about in the previous video, what would you use python for? Give a short description (5-6 sentences) of a project that you would implement and how python would be used for it. What possible libraries would you use? Has anyone done a project similar to this before? Mention both the libraries you can use and the similar project in your description and give a link to both of these.

    *Hint* : Search "python library for (insert technology you are interested in here)" to find relevant libraries


## Installation

In order to get started with Python, please install *Anaconda*, a Python distrubution which includes many libraries and tools that you might need for future sections of this class. With Anaconda, you can install **Python, Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio Code (VS Code), and many other very helpful tools. Please install Anaconda with the link below**, with VSCode, which is included in the Anaconda installer. **Please follow the video below or TA's if you are unable to install Anaconda with Python working. **
