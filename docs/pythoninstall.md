### [Problem 1]

!!!question
    **Brainstorming time!**

    Based of of the topics and uses talked about in the previous video, what would you use python for? Give a short description (5-6 sentences) of a project that you would implement and how python would be used for it. What possible libraries would you use? Has anyone done a project similar to this before? Mention both the libraries you can use and the similar project in your description and give a link to both of these.

    *Hint* : Search "python library for (insert technology you are interested in here)" to find relevant libraries


## Installation

In order to get started with Python, please install *Anaconda*, a Python distrubution which includes many libraries and tools that you might need for future sections of this class. With Anaconda, you can install **Python, Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio Code (VS Code), and many other very helpful tools. Please install Anaconda with the link below**, with VSCode, which is included in the Anaconda installer. **Please follow the video below or TA's if you are unable to install Anaconda with Python working. **

## Assignment Instructions

!!! info
    In order to submit this assignment, please create a formatted document with. Ensure that the **document has both your name and PID, with each problem clearly labeled**. 

    ### Coding Questions

    For coding questions, please provide **both the code you wrote and any output** that is requested by the problem. In addition, **please format the code and output for each problem**. We recommend [CodeBlocks Syntax Highlighting for Google Docs](https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/code_blocks/100740430168) or using [MS words highlighting](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/387453/how-do-you-display-code-snippets-in-ms-word-preserving-format-and-syntax-highlig). If the question includes both code and a question, please include the answer and your code and output

    ### Academic Integrity

    While we won't run everyone's code, if there is any suspicion that your code does not work, we will run it to ensure that your output matches the output you provided in your document. In addition, we will compare your code to other's so please do not copy other's code, this is an academic integrity violation and will be handled accordingly. 



## Additional Info

Also just a last note before we start on this, some of what is covered in the Python section of the class may seem very easy or hard depending on your experience. This was intended for students who already know another coding language, and as a review into Python for those who already know it. **If you have not taken a class such as ECE 15 or CSE 11 in the past or are not familiar with coding, please ask help from the TA's or take a short, beginners Python course in conjunction with this section of the class such as [CodeAcademy's Python course](https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/language/python)**
